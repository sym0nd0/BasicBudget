# BasicBudget

A multi-user personal budgeting and debt management application built with React 19, TypeScript, and a Node.js/SQLite backend. BasicBudget helps households track monthly income and expenses, manage debts with full repayment schedules, track savings goals, and visualise their financial picture through interactive charts — with per-household data isolation, optional TOTP 2FA, and OIDC single sign-on.

> **Disclaimer:** BasicBudget was entirely created using [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) by Anthropic. As with any AI-generated code, caution should be exercised — use entirely at your own risk. PRs and contributions are welcome; even more so, if someone who knows what they're actually doing forks it and improves it.

## Features

### Authentication & Security
- Email + password registration and login (Argon2id, 64 MB memory cost)
- Email verification flow on registration
- Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts (30-minute lock)
- TOTP 2FA via authenticator app (QR code setup, 10 single-use recovery codes); status badge in settings; reset 2FA with password + OTP/recovery code; "lost access" delayed-reset flow via email (callable from settings or after failed login)
- Generic OpenID Connect (OIDC) single sign-on — any OIDC-compatible provider
- Session management with device fingerprinting and new-device email alerts
- Active session list with per-session revocation; sessions display parsed browser and OS instead of raw user-agent string
- Password reset and email change flows via time-limited tokens
- CSRF protection (double-submit cookie), Helmet security headers, rate limiting

### Households & RBAC
- Every user belongs to a household (created automatically on registration)
- **Owner** role: read and write all household entries; can customise household name; view and rescind active invites; manage member roles and remove members
- **Member** role: read all entries, write only own entries; can leave the household at any time
- Invite members by email (7-day expiring token); invitees who don't have an account are automatically joined to the household upon registration — no separate accept step required; role management by owner
- All financial data is isolated per household

### Admin Panel
- The **first registered user** is automatically promoted to system admin
- Admin-only panel accessible from the sidebar under the "Admin" section
- **User management**: list all users, promote/demote roles, lock/unlock accounts, delete users
- **System settings**: configure SMTP (email), OIDC (SSO), structured logging, expense categories, and registration at runtime via the UI — no restart required
  - **Registration**: toggle public sign-up on or off; when disabled, new accounts can only be created via household invites or directly by admins (the first user on a fresh instance can always register)
  - **Logging**: set minimum log level (debug, info, warn, error) to control verbosity of server output; output is JSON-formatted for container and log aggregation compatibility
  - **Expense categories**: add, remove, reorder, or reset to defaults
- **Database backup and restore**: download a full JSON backup of all users, households, budget data, and system settings; restore from a backup file for instance migration or disaster recovery (admin-only; invalidates all sessions on restore); **automated scheduled backups** to server disk with configurable interval and retention limit
- **Audit log**: paginated, filterable log of all authentication and admin actions
- All admin actions are written to the audit log

### Dashboard
- At-a-glance budget summary showing total income, total expenses, total debt payments, and disposable income
- Expense donut chart broken down by category
- Income vs Expenses bar chart
- Debt payoff timeline showing cumulative balance across all debts month by month

### Income Management
- Add, edit, and delete income sources with contributor names
- Record the day of month income is received; track as gross or net
- Set recurrence type: monthly, weekly, fortnightly, or yearly
- Optional start and end dates for time-bounded income entries
- Sortable table columns (name, amount, day, type)

### Expense Management
- Add, edit, and delete expenses
- Configurable expense categories managed by admin; fixed or variable tag
- Assign expenses to a named payment account, including joint accounts visible to all household members
- Assign expenses to specific household members for tracking contributions
- Mark expenses as household expenses with a configurable split ratio so only your share counts in budget summaries
- Set recurrence type (including fortnightly) and optional start/end dates
- Sortable table columns (name, amount, your share, day, category, type)

### Debt Management
- Add, edit, and delete debts
- Record balance, APR, minimum payment, and overpayment amount
- **Deal periods** — track multiple interest rate periods per debt (e.g. 0% intro offer for 12 months, then 19.9% APR); repayment schedule automatically applies correct rate for each month; optional email reminder X months before a deal period ends
- Full per-debt repayment schedule: month-by-month opening balance, interest charge, principal paid, and closing balance; rates vary automatically if deal periods are set
- Payoff summary: months remaining, total interest paid, projected payoff date
- Debt payoff chart plotting all balances on a shared monthly timeline
- Sortable table columns (name, balance, APR, min payment)

### Savings
- Create and track savings with optional target amounts and monthly contributions
- Optional target dates; progress bars shown only when a target is set
- Mark savings goals as household goals to split the target equally among all household members
- Assign savings goals to specific household members for individual tracking

### Reports
- **Overview section** — at-a-glance summary cards (income, expenses, debt payments, savings, disposable) plus month-over-month change indicators showing absolute £ change and percentage
- **Trends section** — multi-month income vs expenses grouped bar chart showing financial patterns across the selected period
- **Spending section** — expense breakdown donut chart showing spending proportions by category across the entire period
- **Debt section** — debt projection line chart displaying all debts' balances over time with per-debt visibility
- **Detail section** — exact monthly figures in tabular format for reference
- **Flexible time ranges** — single time range selector governs all reports (1W, 1M, 3M, YTD, 1Y, 2Y, 5Y, All)

### Settings & Appearance
- Manage named payment accounts, including joint accounts shared across all household members; month locking to prevent edits on closed months
- Change password, change email, 2FA setup/disable
- CSV import (expenses, incomes, debts, and savings goals) and JSON export for bulk data management and backups
- **Version update notifications** — opt-in sidebar badge notifying admins when a new release is available on GitHub
- **Colour blindness palettes** — per-user accessibility setting (server-persisted); choose from Default, Deuteranopia (blue/orange), Protanopia (teal/pink), or Tritanopia (green/red); affects status colours and charts
- **Date & time format preferences** — per-user selection of date format (DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD) and time format (12-hour or 24-hour); applied across all date/time displays in the application

### Additional
- **Duplicate detection** — warns before saving an entry identical to an existing one
- **Theme toggle** — light, dark, and system-preference modes
- **Filter bar** — filter entries by contributor, account, category, or recurrence type; toggle a date range picker to cycle through a from/to month window

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or later
- npm 10 or later

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Configure environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Minimum required for local development:

```env
SESSION_SECRET=change_me_at_least_32_characters_long
TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
APP_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for the full reference.

### Run in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts two processes concurrently:
- **Vite** dev server at `http://localhost:5173` (React frontend with HMR)
- **Express** API server at `http://localhost:3001` (watched by `tsx`)

The Vite config proxies all `/api/*` requests to the Express server automatically. The SQLite database is created automatically at `data/basicbudget.db` on first run.

### Run tests

```bash
npm test
```

Uses an in-memory SQLite database. No `.env` required.

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

Compiles the frontend to `dist/` and the server to `dist-server/`. Run with `npm start`.

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Yes | Min 32-char random string for session signing |
| `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Yes | 64 hex chars (32 bytes) for AES-256-GCM TOTP secret encryption |
| `APP_URL` | No | Public URL of the app (default `http://localhost:5173`); set in production for correct email links |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | No | Allowed CORS origin (defaults to `APP_URL` value) |
| `DB_PATH` | No | Path to SQLite file (default `data/basicbudget.db`) |
| `PORT` | No | Server port (default `3001`; Docker uses `3000`) |
| `NODE_ENV` | No | Execution environment: `development`, `production`, or `test` (default `development`) |
| `COOKIE_SECURE` | No | Set to `false` when `APP_URL` is `http://` (a startup warning fires if this may be needed); defaults to `true` in production, `false` in development |

> **SMTP and OIDC** are configured through the **Admin Panel** (`/admin/settings`) at runtime — no environment variables or restarts needed. If `SMTP_HOST` / `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` are present in the environment on first startup, they are automatically migrated into the database for backwards compatibility with existing deployments.

---

## Docker Deployment

The app is published as a pre-built image to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) on every push to `master`. The multi-stage Dockerfile produces a minimal Node.js Alpine image; Express serves everything. A non-root user (`appuser`) is used inside the container with automatic volume ownership correction via `entrypoint.sh`.

### Pull and run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

The app is served on **http://localhost:8080**.

All secrets are passed via environment variables. Create a `.env` file alongside `compose.yml` (Docker Compose picks it up automatically):

```env
SESSION_SECRET=<random 32+ char string>
TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<64 hex chars>
APP_URL=https://budget.example.com
```

SMTP and OIDC are configured through the Admin Panel after first login.

Data is persisted in a named Docker volume (`bb-data`) mounted at `/app/data`. The container is configured with `restart: unless-stopped` to automatically recover from failures.

### Update to the latest image

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

### Stop

```bash
docker compose down
```

---

## Available Scripts

| Script | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Dev server | `npm run dev` | Start Vite + Express concurrently with hot reload |
| Build (all) | `npm run build` | Type-check and bundle frontend + compile server |
| Start | `npm start` | Run the compiled production server |
| Test | `npm test` | Run all tests (Vitest + Supertest, in-memory DB) |
| Test watch | `npm run test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode |
| Lint | `npm run lint` | Run ESLint across src/, server/, shared/ |

---

## Architecture

### Request flow

```
Browser (React SPA)
      │  HTTP / JSON
      ▼
Express API Server  (port 3001 dev / 3000 prod)
      │
      ▼
SQLite Database  (data/basicbudget.db)
```

In development, Vite serves the frontend on port 5173 and proxies `/api/*` to Express on port 3001. In production, Express serves the pre-built static bundle and handles all API requests from the same origin.

### TypeScript split

Three separate compilation units share `shared/types.ts`:

| Config | Scope |
|---|---|
| `tsconfig.app.json` | `src/` — bundler mode (Vite owns emit) |
| `tsconfig.node.json` | `vite.config.ts` |
| `tsconfig.server.json` | `server/`, `shared/` — emits to `dist-server/`, NodeNext |

Server imports use `.js` extensions on `.ts` source files (NodeNext requirement).

### Session & CSRF

Sessions are stored in SQLite via a custom `SqliteSessionStore`. Cookies: `bb.sid` (session), `bb.csrf` (CSRF double-submit). CSRF tokens are fetched from `GET /api/auth/csrf-token` and sent as the `X-CSRF-Token` header on all mutating requests.

### TOTP encryption

TOTP secrets are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before being stored in the database. The encryption key is `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (32 bytes, hex-encoded). Each secret gets a unique IV and auth tag stored alongside it.

### Money

All monetary values are stored and passed as **integer pence** (e.g. £3,000.89 → `300089`) to avoid floating-point precision issues. `src/utils/formatters.ts` handles conversion to display format.

### Recurring engine

`filterActiveInMonth(items, yearMonth)` determines whether each income/expense is active in a given month based on `recurrence_type`, `start_date`, `end_date`, and `posting_day`. Weekly items have their `amount_pence` multiplied by the number of occurrences in the month.

### Data isolation

Every data table has a `household_id` foreign key. All queries are scoped to `req.householdId`, set by the `requireAuth` middleware. Cross-household access is structurally impossible at the query level.

---

## Data Models

All types are defined in `shared/types.ts` and re-exported from `src/types/index.ts`.
